# Langchain with Python Integration

This repository demonstrates how to integrate the Langchain library with OpenAI and HuggingFace's Google Bard to create a powerful language model that can fetch updated information from the web.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through the setup and basic usage of Langchain with Python. By the end of this, you'll have a functional system capable of making informed responses based on the most recent data.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Access to OpenAI and HuggingFace APIs

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create your API Keys from OpenAI and HuggingFace

## Usage

The repository is structured into four key sections:


### 1. Testing with Prompts

Explore various prompts and compare the responses generated using both the OpenAI and Google Bard integrations.

### 2. Module for Fetching Updated Information

Most current Large Language Models (LLMs) lack up-to-date information, as they were trained on historical data (e.g., GPT was trained on data up to September 2021). This section introduces a module that connects the LLM to various content mechanisms like Wikipedia and Google Search to fetch and incorporate the latest information.
